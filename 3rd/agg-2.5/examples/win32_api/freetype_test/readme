This example demonstrates the use of the FreeType font rendering 
engine (http://freetype.org). Please get file "timesi.ttf" before 
running this example. You can download it from:
http://www.antigrain.com/timesi.zip

Note that the building environment expects 
FreeType installed into the root directory, that is, "\freetype2". 
It supposed to be compiled in "Debug" and "Release" configurations. 
If you install FreeType somewhere else please correct the paths
to the include and library directories.

Using affine transformations for images looks tricky, but it's not, especially 
when you understand the main idea. You can apply any affine transformations 
to images of any size and draw any part of the image.

This example demonstrates the ideas of constructing affine matrices for 
images. The example contains 6 variants of scaling/rotation/translation 
matrices. Also, there are the following important variables:

m_polygon_angle;
m_polygon_scale;

m_image_angle;
m_image_scale;

m_image_center_x;
m_image_center_y;

m_polygon_cx;
m_polygon_cy;

m_image_cx;
m_image_cy;


Variables m_polygon_... refer to the source path (star) that will be used to 
transform the image, variables m_image_... refer to the image parametres. 
Actually, different variants of transformations use different variables 
(in some cases m_polygon_... is used to create the image affine matrix). 
The meaning of the variables is the following:

m_polygon_angle;
m_polygon_scale; 

Are actually two slider controls on the left. 

m_polygon_cx;
m_polygon_cy; 

Are the center of the "star", that is the geometric center of the source path. 
You can drag the "star" with the left mouse button.

m_image_angle;
m_image_scale;

are two respective sliders on the right.

m_image_cx;
m_image_cy;

are the coordinates of the green marker. The marker can also be dragged.

m_image_center_x;
m_image_center_y;

are the center of the image. You can consider them as constants.  
In certain cases it's easier to understand the idea when we have some 
"reference point", like the center or the origin of the axes.

The image transformation matrix doesn't depend on anything else.
It means that the code above the line "// --------------(Example 0)":

    polygon_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_translation(-m_polygon_cx, -m_polygon_cy);
    polygon_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_rotation(m_polygon_angle.value() * agg::pi / 180.0);
    polygon_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_scaling(m_polygon_scale.value());
    polygon_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_translation(m_polygon_cx, m_polygon_cy);

affects only the drawn path. So, the only way to shift, rotate, or scale the
image is to use the image affine matrix (image_mtx in this example).

Another important thing is that due to the nature of the algorithm you 
have to use the inverse transformations. The algorithm takes the 
coordinates of every destination pixel, applies the transformations and 
obtains the coordinates of the pixel to pick it up from the source image. 
The coordinates of the destination pixels are always known and they have 
regular, pixel accuracy. After transforming they usually fall somewhere "
between" pixels. This fact allows us to apply anti-aliasing filters like 
bilinear, bicubic, sinc, blackman, etc. After filtering we know the value of the 
destination pixel and we can put it in its place. This is why the algorithm 
uses the inverse affine matrix. In other words you prepare the transformation 
matrix as usual and then invret it before using:

    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_translation(-m_image_center_x, -m_image_center_y);
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_rotation(m_polygon_angle.value() * agg::pi / 180.0);
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_scaling(m_polygon_scale.value());
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_translation(m_polygon_cx, m_polygon_cy);
    image_mtx.invert();

This code illustrates the behaviour when we have synchronous transformations
of the source path and the image. 

Well, let us return to example 0. Here we have a "star" that can be dragged with 
the left mouse button, a small round green marker, and four sliders. 
The marker and the sliders on the right don't affect anything. As it was said, 
this example simply copies pixels from the source image to the destination canvas. 

Example 1. The marker and the image sliders on the right still
don't work, but now the image is moved, scaled, and rotated syncronously with
the "star". We simply take the reference point, which is m_image_center_x(y), 
rotate and scale the image around it, and then, translate the image to 
m_polygon_cx(cy). 


Example 2 is the same as 1 but instead of using "m_polygon_..." parameters we 
use "m_image_..." ones, so the marker and the sliders on the right now work 
independently. In other words you can control the image and the "star" separately.
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_translation(-m_image_center_x, -m_image_center_y);
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_rotation(m_image_angle.value() * agg::pi / 180.0);
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_scaling(m_image_scale.value());
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_translation(m_image_cx, m_image_cy);
    image_mtx.invert();


Example 3 is the same as the above but instead of using "m_image_cx(cy)" we use 
m_polygon_cx(cy). So that, the image is rotated and scaled around its center, 
but the marker doesn't have any effect.
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_translation(-m_image_center_x, -m_image_center_y);
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_rotation(m_image_angle.value() * agg::pi / 180.0);
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_scaling(m_image_scale.value());
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_translation(m_polygon_cx, m_polygon_cy);
    image_mtx.invert();


Example 4 is the same as 1, but we use m_image_cx(cy) as the source point 
in the image. So, the image sliders don't work, the image is transformed 
synchronously with the path, but we are able to choose the source point for 
image transformations. That is the idea: we take the source point in the 
image, perform the transformations around it and then move this source
point to the center of the "star".
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_translation(-m_image_cx, -m_image_cy);
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_rotation(m_polygon_angle.value() * agg::pi / 180.0);
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_scaling(m_polygon_scale.value());
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_translation(m_polygon_cx, m_polygon_cy);
    image_mtx.invert();


Example 5 is the same as 2, but there we have a combination of the scaling 
and rotation of the "star" and the image.
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_translation(-m_image_center_x, -m_image_center_y);
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_rotation(m_image_angle.value() * agg::pi / 180.0);
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_rotation(m_polygon_angle.value() * agg::pi / 180.0);
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_scaling(m_image_scale.value());
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_scaling(m_polygon_scale.value());
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_translation(m_image_cx, m_image_cy);
    image_mtx.invert();
BTW, code above can be simplified like this:
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_translation(-m_image_center_x, -m_image_center_y);
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_rotation(m_image_angle.value() * agg::pi / 180.0 + 
                                            m_polygon_angle.value() * agg::pi / 180.0);
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_scaling(m_image_scale.value() * m_polygon_scale.value());
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_translation(m_image_cx, m_image_cy);
    image_mtx.invert();


Finally, example 5 is probably not very interesting in practice, but still, it 
can simplify understanding of the idea. This example uses only m_image_... 
parameters. It shifts the image from m_image_cx(cy) to the origin (0,0), then 
applies rotation and scaling, and finally, shifts the image back. So that, 
point m_image_cx(cy) is simply the center of the transformations. When the 
image angle is 0.0 and the scale is 1.0 dragging this point doesn't have any
effect.
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_translation(-m_image_cx, -m_image_cy);
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_rotation(m_image_angle.value() * agg::pi / 180.0);
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_scaling(m_image_scale.value());
    image_mtx *= agg::trans_affine_translation(m_image_cx, m_image_cy);
    image_mtx.invert();


Many thank to you if you read it and many special thanks if you could understand
something. :-)

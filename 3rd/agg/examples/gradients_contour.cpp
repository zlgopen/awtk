				"stroking the path, which is then the source of color level in the underlying\n"
				"gradient function. Contour gradient can be used in two forms. One is to define   \n"
				"shape for contour different from shape of object being drawn. Second is to\n"
				"use the same shape for contour and for drawing (AutoContour).\n\n"

				"Assymetric conic gradient (also called angle) is the same as conic, but the ray\n"
				"of light with color transitions going counter clockwise travels whole circle\n"
				"instead of just half (as with conic).\n\n"

				"Bitmap gradient is very similar to pattern fill, but works in the framework of\n"
				"gradient functions interfaces. Because of that all interpolator transformations\n"
				"from gradient span generator can be applied to this kind of fill.\n\n"

				"How to play with:\n\n"

				"Try to fiddle with C1,C2 & D1,D2 parameters to see, how interestingly\n"
				"the gradient transitions changes (each time a new DT is computed).\n"
				"DT is reused when the color ramp changes.\n\n"

				"Use +/- keys to Rotate polygon\n"
				"Use PgUp/PdDn keys to Zoom polygon\n\n"
